## Instructions

Make a new Firebase Project. You will also need Google Calendars API access key. 

Copy `environment.tmp.ts` to `environment.ts` and fill it out with valid Credentials.

Do not commit your `environment.ts` or `environment.prod.ts`!

Note: There are default variables for the DB that are required. I will figoure out a script to put those in for you at some point. Sorry :/
